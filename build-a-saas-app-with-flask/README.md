### How does this source code differ than what's in the course?

In the course we build up a 4,000+ line Flask application in 15 stages while I'm
at your side explaining my thought process along the way.

You will get to see the source code grow from a single `app.py` file to a large
code base that spans across dozens of files and folders.

This repo includes up to the 6th stage. By this point in the code base, you'll
be introduced to concepts such as:

- Using Docker to "Dockerize" a multi-service Flask app
- Using Flask extensions
- Flask blueprints
- Jinja templates
- Working with forms
- Sending e-mails through Celery
- Creating Click based CLI scripts
- Testing and analyzing your code base

The rest of the course covers topics such as:

- What is Docker and how can you use it?
- Going over the application's architecture and tech choices
- Creating a full blown user management system
- Creating a custom admin dashboard
- Logging, middleware and error handling
- Adding quality of life improvements to the CLI script
- Accepting recurring credit card payments with Stripe
- Building up a dice game called "Snake Eyes"
- Responding with JSON from Flask and creating AJAX requests
- Processing microtransaction payments with Stripe
- Dealing with database migrations
- Converting your app to support multiple languages (i18n)

**By the time you finish my course, you'll have all the confidence you need to
build a large web application with Flask**.
